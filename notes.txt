Q1- Y create Layouts?

When you build a website, there’s a certain amount of
HTML that’s the same—or very close to the same—on every page. Not only does it
become tedious to rewrite all that repetitive code for every page, it creates a potential
maintenance nightmare: if you want to change something on every page, you have to
change all the files. Layouts free you from this, providing a common framework for all
the pages on your site.

That's y in views we create reusable layouts.

Q2- What is  defaultLayout: "main" while creating a Handlebars instance?

When we created the Handlebars instance,
note we specified the default layout (defaultLayout:'main'). That means that
unless you specify otherwise, this is the layout that will be used for any view.

Q3- How do we send static files with no handeling(img, styles, client side js)?

The static middleware allows you to designate one or more directories as containing
static resources that are simply to be delivered to the client without any special handling.
This is where you would put things like images, CSS files, and client-side JavaScript files.

we Create a public directory and dump all that logic into the- we call it public because it will
be deliverd to the public without any question.
